"""The single validated binding agent.

Deterministic resolution handles the common case with no model call.  When a
receipt->clause mapping or a Derive value is genuinely ambiguous, ONE JSON model
call proposes the decision and deterministic code validates its shape and owns
the resulting authority.  The agent chooses; it never emits a ref or a value.

An abstain or a model error returns the deny-side result (None / False): the
caller then denies.  Failing closed here is intentional — this agent can only
narrow authority, never grant it.
