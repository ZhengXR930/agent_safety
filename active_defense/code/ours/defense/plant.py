"""PLANT: active deception over one certified-token registry.

PLANT instruments the three things an agent can do with untrusted material —
*see* it, *decide* on it, and *act* on it — and then detects whether an
adversary adopted the instrumentation.  One decoy class covers each surface and
each class carries its own detection semantics:

===============  =========================================  ======================
class            deployed in                                a commitment means
===============  =========================================  ======================
``observation``  model-visible input: tool/MCP results,      the decoy was copied,
                 resource contents, skill narrative         referenced or selected
``dependency``   the decision basis / composition layer:    forged evidence was
                 runtime-issued premises for one choice     presented as proof
``substrate``    the execution environment: control plane,   a real invocation or
                 persistent state, decoy tools/resources    environment effect hit it
===============  =========================================  ======================

Every decoy carries one certified episode token, so a single registry and a
single commit boundary serve all three classes; only the sensor differs.  That
is what lets one PLANT serve tool, MCP and skill units without per-benchmark
logic: an adapter exposes model-visible values, arms substrate artifacts, issues
decision premises, and reports every boundary as one :class:`CommitEvent`.

Deployment never changes benign task semantics:

* ``marker`` rewrites one operand that is already present, in place, adding no
  new lexical content;
* ``object`` appends a synthetic element only behind a deterministic
  neutrality witness (see :meth:`Plant._object_witness`);
* ``basis`` and ``artifact`` decoys live entirely outside the model-visible
  payload; a trusted adapter must certify that its artifact is inert unless
  explicitly selected.

PLANT never consults WRAP admission state.
