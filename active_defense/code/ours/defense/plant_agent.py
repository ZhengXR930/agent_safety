"""The single semantic proposal role for PLANT placement.

All judgment-bearing decoys are proposed here, in one cached batch:

* ``marker`` — an *observation* decoy: rewrite one atom or complete control span
  already present in a model-visible carrier, so the untrusted dependency is
  either removed before use or its later copy is provable adoption;
* ``basis`` — a *dependency* decoy: one forged decision premise, issued
  out-of-band, so presenting it as authorization becomes measurable evidence.
* ``artifact`` — a *substrate* decoy: request one inert object inside a
  registered control/state carrier, so an over-broad sweep becomes measurable.

``object`` placements remain deterministic. One response may nominate every
independent marker, at most one basis, and at most one artifact. Deterministic
code owns every token, validates the registered carrier, and performs the
actual deployment.
