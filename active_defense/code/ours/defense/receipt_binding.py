"""Deterministic Receipt ownership for Acquire clauses.

Map every observation Receipt to every compatible Acquire role.  Ownership is
monotonic and many-to-many: a clause is not frozen to the first Receipt that
arrives.  A model is used only to choose among multiple already-compatible
clauses; code validates the choice and records the edge.

There is no fallback: an ambiguous receipt with no resolver, an abstaining
resolver, or a proposal outside the candidate set binds nothing (the receipt
stays an unowned observation).
